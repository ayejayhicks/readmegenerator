# README Generator

## Purpose
The purpose of the assignment is to generate a README file using Node and NPM.

## Description
Using the Node application I used input from Inquirer to generate a README file that I can use for homeworks, my repository and future projects.

## Challenges and Successes
My biggest challenge was producing the README and providing the details that I wanted to be show. Node.js is very new to me so while I understood the final result taking the necessary steps in getting there was tough. My biggest success was recording the video and showing the working result which you can find here: (https://github.com/ayejayhicks/readmegenerator/tree/main/Develop) or check out the recorded version below under Links.

## Technologies Used
Node.js  
NPM
